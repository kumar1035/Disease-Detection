# Python Lab 2.0 - Jupyter Notebook Project

## 🩻 Problem Statement

**Image Processing, Feature Extraction Using Whirling Golden Triangle, and Machine Learning Classification of Bone X-ray Images for Detection of Osteoporosis, Osteopenia, and Normal Bone Conditions**

The proposed method combining image processing, Golden Whirling Triangle-based feature extraction, and machine learning classification shows promising results in categorizing bone health from X-ray images. This approach is interpretable, efficient, and adaptable to real-world clinical applications, especially in areas with limited access to advanced imaging technologies.
